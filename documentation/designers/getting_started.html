<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
	PyroCMS supports themes which allow you to easily change the look and feel of your web-site.
	The way it works is with a master <a href="designers/layouts.html">layout</a> file and 
	multiple <a href="designers/partials.html">partials</a> that share presentation logic between different layouts.
</p>

<h2>Creating a theme</h2>

<p>Like modules, themes are stored in two places: <dfn>addons/themes &amp; system/pyrocms/themes</dfn>. Each folder inside there is a single theme.</p>

<p>
	To create your first theme it is a good idea to look at the default theme and see how it works. You might even like
	to copy it and tweak it to create your own. The default theme is a "core theme" so it is located in <dfn>system/pyrocms/themes/default</dfn>. Copy that to
	<dfn>addons/themes/custom</dfn> or whatever name you like.
</p>

<h2>Folders</h2>

<ul>
	<li>css</li>
	<li>img</li>
	<li>js</li>
	<li>views</li>
	<li>views/layouts</li>
	<li>views/partials</li>
	<li>views/modules</li>
</ul>

<h3>theme.php</h3>

<p>
	Each theme has it's own information. Author, version, web-site, etc. These used to be stored in a theme.xml file but in v1.0 we changed that to
	theme.php to make it more flexible and to keep in sync with other Add-ons. This file is located in the root of each theme, here:
</p>

<blockquote><dfn>addons/themes/custom/theme.php</dfn></blockquote>

<p>
	No real PHP experience is required to edit this file, just remember to put a \ before any ' you write into the strings or you will create a syntax
	error. As mentioned below in the Theme Options section the "public $options" array is optional. If you do not want to add options simply remove 
	that section.

                                      'options'       => '2 column=Two Column|full-width=Full Width',
                                      'is_required'   => TRUE),
     );

<h3>Theme Options</h3>
<p>
	This feature is optional and may not be necessary for simple themes
	but for more complex themes it is can be very helpful. The options defined here are accessible in the admin panel via Design > Themes > Options.
	If you are creating a theme and add another option to theme.php just click the Re-index button in the Options window. This will load the
	latest options from your theme.php file.
</p>

<p>
	The available form types are:
	<ul>
		<li>radio</li>
		<li>checkbox</li>
		<li>select</li>
		<li>select-multiple</li>
		<li>text</li>
		<li>textarea</li>
		<li>password</li>
	</ul>
	If we were to use a tag to access this example it would look like this:
<pre><code>{pyro:theme:options option="layout"}</code></pre>
	And it would output either "2 column" or "full-width" depending on the selection in the dropdown in the admin panel.
</p>

	<h3>screenshot.png</h3>
	So you can see a preview of your theme in the CP > Design > Themes area you will need to create a screenshot and place it
	in <dfn>addons/themes/custom/screenshot.png</dfn>. Make it any size you like but 500x400 is probably about right.
</p>
