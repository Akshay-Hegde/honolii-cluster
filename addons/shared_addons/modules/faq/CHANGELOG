Fixed ckeditor issue l.lang.contextmenu is undefined

*version 0.4*
Code Style Changes
Fixed CKEDITOR init errors - ajax should now function correctly

*version 0.5*
Made compatible with PyroCMS v1.2 - Due to this,  this version will likely break
in earlier versions.  The problem lies in the js.  You will need to add
var SITE_URL = 'http://www.example.com/index.php/'; to the js/faq.js file for it to work
in PyroCMS versions BEFORE v1.2

Fixed uniform select issues.
Fixed text box size of the edit category form
Fixed sorting issues
